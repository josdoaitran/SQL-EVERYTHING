_Summary_: in this tutorial, we will introduce you to a PostgreSQL sample database that you can use for learning and practice PostgreSQL.

We will use the DVD rental database for demonstrating the features of PostgreSQL.

The DVD rental database was ported from the sakila sample database for PostgreSQL with some adjustments. The DVD rental database represents business processes of a DVD rental store. The DVD rental database has many objects including:

+ 15 tables
+ 1 trigger
+ 7 views
+ 8 functions
+ 1 domain
+ 13 sequences
